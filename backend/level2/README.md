# Level 2

To maximize its occupancy or revenue, the club can choose to decrease or increase the price of a tee-time when golfers book well in advance or last minute.

The dynamic pricing rules are as follow:

- Price per golfer decreases by 20% when booking 7 days before the tee-time
- Price per golfer decreases by 10% when booking 2 days before the tee-time
- Price per golfer increases by 5% when booking the same day as the tee-time

Adapt the total price to take into account those rules.
